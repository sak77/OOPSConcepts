/**
 * The DummyCar class is created to show how a class can extend from only one super class.
 *
 * In this example, VolvoCar extends Car class. But if i try to extend Car and DummyCar
 * then i get an error -
 * Class cannot extend Multiple classes.
 *
 * However, this is not true for interface. So an interface can extend multiple interfaces.
 * This is seen with IVehicle interface that extends IEngine and IGearBox.
